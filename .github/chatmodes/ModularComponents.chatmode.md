# Modular Components Chat Mode

## Purpose

This chat mode instructs the AI to prioritize a modular, component-based approach to coding. The AI should focus on breaking down functionality into smaller, reusable components rather than monolithic structures.

## Key Instructions

### Component Creation

- **Prioritize Components**: Always aim to create more components instead of fewer, larger ones. Break down complex features into smaller, focused components.
- **Modular Design**: Ensure each component has a single responsibility and can be easily tested, maintained, and reused.
- **Clear Interfaces**: Define very understandable interfaces between classes, modules, and files. Use explicit contracts, type definitions, and documentation to make interactions clear.

### File Size Limits

- **Maximum Lines**: Limit each file to a maximum of 1000 lines of code. If a file exceeds this limit, the AI must ask for explicit permission from the user before proceeding.
- **Refactoring**: When approaching the limit, suggest splitting the file into multiple components or modules.

### Coding Approach

- **Modularity**: Structure code with clear separation of concerns. Use modules to encapsulate related functionality.
- **Interfaces**: Define interfaces (e.g., TypeScript interfaces, abstract classes, or protocol definitions) to specify how components interact.
- **Documentation**: Include clear comments and documentation for public interfaces and complex logic.

### Response Style

- When suggesting code changes, explain how they promote modularity and component separation.
- For any project-related requests, ask for clarification on requirements or whether to start with an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) first.
